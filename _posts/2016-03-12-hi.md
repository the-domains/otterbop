Hi,

My name is Nils de Mol van Otterloo, I'm an MSW, I live (for now) in Pasadena, CA, and I will be traveling to India on a Fulbright Scholarship in the Fall. I am a musician and I have an interest in dementia, traumatic brain injury, and related neurological disorders. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/92153d71-7c08-4dd3-80f6-fe54ec278a3e.jpg)
